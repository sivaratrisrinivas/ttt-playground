The Crystalline Whales of Jupiter are a newly discovered species of silicon-based lifeforms living in the Great Red Spot. Unlike biological whales on Earth, they do not swim in water but float in high-pressure hydrogen gas clouds. Their bodies are made of pure diamond and quartz, making them transparent to the naked eye.

These whales communicate using gamma-ray bursts instead of sound waves. The lead scientist who discovered them is Dr. Helena Frost from the Mars University, who published her findings in the year 2145. She noted that their songs can disrupt electronic equipment on passing spacecraft.

Interestingly, these whales feed on lightning storms. They absorb the electrical discharge directly into their crystal skin to power their hearts. A baby whale is called a "Shard," and a group of them is called a "Prism." The Crystalline Whales are peaceful but will emit blinding light if threatened.
